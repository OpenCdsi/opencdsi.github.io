I"§	<p>The goal of the project is to create clinical decision support software for 
immunizations based on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/cdsi.html">CDSi Logic Spec</a> developed by the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-open-cdsi">Why Open CDSi?</h2>

<p>CDSi software is part of an <em>immunization information system</em> (IIS) which
itself can be part of an <em>electron health records</em> (EHR) system. Itâ€™s purpose is to
evaluate a patients immunization histroy and then forecast the next vaccine doses
required for a patient to achieve immunity to the covered antigens.</p>

<p>There are many IIS implementations in operation at state government agencies,
hospitals, and clinics. The implementations tend to be proprietary products that
are licenseable for a fee or, in some cases, free of charge.  <strong>Open CDSi</strong> is 
an attempt to make an open-source, easily updated, and portable immunization decision
support system.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-worldvax">What About WorldVax?</h2>

<p>Way back in 2015 or so my friend and I started <a href="http://worldvax.org">worldvax.org</a> as
an open-source humanitarian project to bring modern immunization tracking technology
to underserved communities. We gave talks, did a podcast, had a simple demo app but
we never really got the traction we needed to make <strong>WorldVax</strong> take off.</p>

<p>Ultimatly, I think our message was muddled. We had a really big, really important vision
but the nuts-and-bolts of our vision lay hidden in the talks and podcast.</p>

<p><strong>Open CDSi</strong> is the nuts-and-bolts of the <strong>WorldVax</strong> vision. This is the technology
that will let us <em>Reach The Rest</em>. To help achieve that goal, the <strong>Open CDSi</strong> project was created on June 20th, 2022 when the domain name <a href="https://opencdse.org">opencdsi.org</a> was registered.</p>
