The goal of the project is to create clinical decision support software for 
immunizations based on the [CDSi Logic Spec](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/cdsi.html) developed by the [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/).

## Why Open CDSi?

CDSi software is part of an *immunization information system* (IIS) which
itself can be part of an *electron health records* (EHR) system. It's purpose is to
evaluate a patients immunization histroy and then forecast the next vaccine doses
required for a patient to achieve immunity to the covered antigens.

## What About WorldVax?

Way back in 2015 or so my friend and I started [worldvax.org](http://worldvax.org) as
an open-source humanitarian project to bring modern immunization tracking technology
to underserved communities. We gave talks, did a podcast, had a simple demo app but
we never really got the traction we needed to make **WorldVax** take off.

Ultimatly, I think our message was muddled. We had a really big, really important vision
but the nuts-and-bolts of our vision lay hidden in the talks and podcast.

**Open CDSi** is the nuts-and-bolts of the **WorldVax** vision. This is the technology
that will let us *Reach The Rest*. To help achieve that goal, the **Open CDSi** project was created on June 20th, 2022 when the domain name [opencdsi.org](https://opencdse.org) was registered.
