It is with a certain level of relief that I've decided to walk away from the OpenCdsi project.
After 10 years I have made little progress with actually implementing the vaccine information
system Jeffrey and I had envisioned back when we started Worldvax.

If someone stumbles across this archive and finds it of any worth, please drop me a note and
let me know. Then I'll know that I'm not floundering in a vaccuum.
