The goal of the  **Open CDSi** project is to create clinical decision support software for 
immunizations based on the [CDSi Logic Spec](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/cdsi.html) developed by the [Centers for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/).

## Why Open CDSi?

CDSi software is part of an *immunization information system* (IIS) which
itself can be part of an *electronic health records* (EHR) system. It's purpose is to
evaluate a patients immunization history and then forecast the next vaccine doses
required by a patient to achieve immunity to the covered antigens.

There are many IIS implementations in operation at state government agencies,
hospitals, and clinics. These implementations tend to be proprietary products that
are generally licenseable, some without fees.  **Open CDSi** is 
an attempt to make an open-source, easily updated, and portable immunization decision
support system.

## What About WorldVax?

Way back in 2013  my friend [Jeffery Miller](mailto:xagronaut+worldvax@gmail.com) and I started [worldvax.org](http://worldvax.org) as
an open-source humanitarian project to bring modern immunization tracking technology
to underserved communities. We gave talks, did a podcast and had a simple demo app but
we never really got the traction we needed to make **WorldVax** take off.

When we put the **WorldVax** project on the backburner, he gave a talk at [Stir Trek 2017](https://stirtrek.com). The 
talk was titled *Reach the Rest - An OpenSource Journey* and was about what we learned from the project. I've got his 
[speaker notes](/assets/20170425-ReachTheRestAnOpenSourceJourney-StirTrek.pdf) but if anybody has a video of his talk I'd love to see it!

**Open CDSi** is the nuts-and-bolts of the **WorldVax** vision. This is the technology
that will let us *Reach The Rest*. To help achieve that goal, the **Open CDSi** project was 
created on June 20th, 2022 when the domain name [opencdsi.org](https://opencdse.org) was registered.
